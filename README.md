# 447_Data_Analysis

## Description
Group project repo for data analysis course of INST447. Our project domain is real estate prices in various zip codes within the Washington metropolitan area (heretofore referred to as the DMV). The primary goal of our project is to retrieve, analyze, and present data which may be used to draw inferences and inform personal or business investment decisions revolving around real estate going into the year 2023. We believe that this data may reveal homogenous traits among certain zip codes which may be correlated with trends in the real estate market.

## Scope
Our scope includes data about the historical trends of the price of rental properties, house values, forecasted house values, and list/sale prices, as well as information about population growth in various zip codes (which usually align with a particular cityâ€™s borders) within the DMV (Ex. Bethesda, Rockville, Reston, Alexandria, Washington D.C.) Our objective is to answer questions about the real estate market in the Washington metropolitan area such as:
* Which zip codes had the greatest increase and decrease in home ownership / residents over time
* Which zip codes experienced the greatest increase or decrease in home value (rental prices, house value on market) historically
* Where might the next booming market be, or which zip code(s) have the highest growth potential
